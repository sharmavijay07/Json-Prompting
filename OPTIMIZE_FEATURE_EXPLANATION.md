# PromptStruct Optimize Feature

## What does the Optimize feature do?

The **Optimize** feature in PromptStruct analyzes your current prompt and provides intelligent suggestions to improve it for better JSON schema generation. Here's how it works:

### 🎯 Purpose
- **Analyzes** your prompt for clarity, specificity, and structure
- **Identifies** areas that could be improved for better AI responses
- **Suggests** specific enhancements to make your prompt more effective
- **Learns** from your feedback to provide better suggestions over time

### 🔍 What it analyzes:
1. **Clarity** - Is your prompt clear and unambiguous?
2. **Specificity** - Are you specific enough about what you want?
3. **Structure** - Is your prompt well-organized?
4. **Context** - Do you provide enough background information?
5. **Parameters** - Are you clear about constraints and requirements?

### 💡 Types of suggestions you might get:
- **Add Context**: Include more specific details about your requirements
- **Improve Clarity**: Make your prompt more clear and specific
- **Add Examples**: Include examples to guide the AI response
- **Better Structure**: Reorganize your prompt for better flow
- **Specify Constraints**: Add clear limitations and requirements

### 🚀 How to use it:
1. Enter your prompt in the PromptStruct input field
2. Click the **🔧 Optimize** button
3. Review the suggestions in the popup
4. Click **Apply** on any suggestion you want to use
5. The suggestion will be automatically added to your prompt

### 🧠 Learning Feature:
The Optimize feature learns from your usage patterns and feedback to provide increasingly relevant suggestions tailored to your prompting style.

### 🔧 Fixed Issues:
- **Undefined values**: Now properly handles different AI response formats
- **Error handling**: Better fallback suggestions when AI responses are malformed
- **Default suggestions**: Provides helpful defaults when no specific optimizations are found

## Example Optimization Flow:

**Original prompt**: "Create a user profile"

**Optimized suggestions might include**:
- Add specific fields you want in the profile
- Specify the data types for each field
- Include validation requirements
- Add example values
- Clarify the use case for the profile

This helps you create more effective prompts that generate better, more structured JSON outputs!
